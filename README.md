## Rules:

1. There are 3 devils and 3 Priests.<br>
2. They all have to cross a river in a boat.<br>
3. Boat can only carry two people at a time.<br>
4. As long as there are equal number of devils and priests,then devils will not eat Priest.<br>
5. If the number of devils are greater than the number of priests on the same side of the river then devils will eat the priests.<br>
6. So how can you make all the 6 peoples to arrive to the other side safely?<br>
