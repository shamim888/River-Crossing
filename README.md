## Rules:

[1] There are 3 devils and 3 Priests.
[2] They all have to cross a river in a boat.
[3] Boat can only carry two people at a time.
[4] As long as there are equal number of devils and priests,then devils will not eat Priest.
[5] If the number of devils are greater than the number of priests on the same side of the river then devils will eat the priests.
[6] So how can you make all the 6 peoples to arrive to the other side safely?
